>> @do you have a code example that uses ipc-channel

Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with a code example that demonstrates how to use the ipc-channel crate for inter-process communication. This example will show both a Multiple Producer Single Consumer (MPSC) and a Multiple Producer Multiple Consumer (MPMC) scenario.
First, make sure to add ipc-channel to your Cargo.toml:
[dependencies]
ipc-channel = "0.16.1"
Now, here's an example that demonstrates both MPSC and MPMC patterns:
ipc_example.rs
use ipc_channel::ipc::{self, IpcReceiver, IpcSender};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // MPSC Example
    let (tx, rx) = ipc::channel().unwrap();

    // Spawn multiple producer threads
    for i in 0..3 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..5 {
                tx.send(format!("Producer {} - Message {}", i, j)).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        });
    }

    // Single consumer
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..15 {
            let msg = rx.recv().unwrap();
            println!("MPSC Received: {}", msg);
        }
    });

    // MPMC Example
    let (server0, server0_name) = ipc::IpcOneShotServer::new().unwrap();
    let (server1, server1_name) = ipc::IpcOneShotServer::new().unwrap();

    // Spawn multiple producer threads
    for i in 0..2 {
        let server0_name = server0_name.clone();
        let server1_name = server1_name.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            for j in 0..3 {
                let (tx, rx) = ipc::channel().unwrap();
                ipc::IpcSender::connect(if i == 0 { &server0_name } else { &server1_name })
                    .unwrap()
                    .send(tx)
                    .unwrap();
                rx.recv().unwrap(); // Wait for acknowledgement
                println!("MPMC Producer {} sent message {}", i, j);
            }
        });
    }

    // Spawn multiple consumer threads
    for i in 0..2 {
        let server = if i == 0 { server0 } else { server1 };
        thread::spawn(move || {
            for _ in 0..3 {
                let tx: IpcSender<()> = server.accept().unwrap();
                let msg = format!("MPMC Consumer {} received message", i);
                println!("{}", msg);
                tx.send(()).unwrap(); // Send acknowledgement
            }
        });
    }

    // Wait for all operations to complete
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
}
This example demonstrates:
1.
MPSC (Multiple Producer Single Consumer):
Creates multiple producer threads that send messages to a single channel.
A single consumer thread receives all messages from this channel.
2.
MPMC (Multiple Producer Multiple Consumer):
Uses IpcOneShotServer to create two servers (acting as consumers).
Multiple producer threads connect to these servers and send messages.
Each server (consumer) receives messages and acknowledges them.
To run this example, you can save it as a separate file (e.g., ipc_example.rs) and run it with cargo run --bin ipc_example (after adding it to your Cargo.toml as a separate binary).
This example showcases the basic usage of ipc-channel for both MPSC and MPMC patterns. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely want to add error handling, proper synchronization, and potentially use shared memory for larger data transfers.
Remember that ipc-channel is designed for inter-process communication, so in a real application, you'd typically have separate executables for producers and consumers, communicating across process boundaries.
